# Overview

Here's a quick overview of the features and usage in Reach Router.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @reach/router
# or
yarn add @reach/router
```

Reach Router is compatible with React 15+.

## Accessibility

Router manages the focus of your app on route transitions. There's nothing you have to do about it, it just happens.

## Rendering

Routers select a child to render based on the child's path. The children are just other components that could be rendered on their own outside of a Router.

```js
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { Router, Link } from "@reach/router"

let Home = () => <div>Home</div>
let Dash = () => <div>Dash</div>

render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard" />
  </Router>
)
```

## Navigate With Link

To navigate around the app, render a `Link` somewhere.

```jsx
let Home = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link> |{" "}
      <Link to="dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
    </nav>
  </div>
)

let Dash = () => <div>Dash</div>

render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard" />
  </Router>
)
```

## Parse Data From the URL

If you need to parse the data out of the URL, use a dynamic segment--they start with a `:`. The parsed value will become a prop sent to the matched component.

```jsx
// at url "/invoice/23"

render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Invoice path="invoice/:invoiceId" />
  </Router>
)

const Invoice = props => (
  <div>
    <h1>Invoice {props.invoiceId}</h1>
  </div>
)
```

It's the same as rendering the component directly.

```jsx
<Invoice invoiceId={23} />
```

## Ambiguous Paths and Ranking

Even though two paths might be ambiguous--like "/:invoiceId" and "/invoices"--Router ranks the paths and renders the one that makes the most sense.

```jsx
render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Invoice path=":invoiceId" />
    <InvoiceList path="invoices" />
  </Router>
)
```

The URL "/invoices" will render `<InvoiceList/>` and "/123" will render `<Invoice invoiceId={123}/>`. Same thing with the `Home` component. Even though it’s defined first, and every path will match "/", `Home` won't render unless the path is exactly "/". So don't worry about the order of your paths.

## Nested Component Paths

You can nest components inside of a Router, and the paths will nest too. The matched child component will come in as the `children` prop, the same as if you'd rendered it directly. (Internally `Router` just renders another `Router`, but I digress...)

```jsx
const Dash = ({ children }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    <hr />
    {children}
  </div>
)

render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard">
      <Invoices path="invoices" />
      <Team path="team" />
    </Dash>
  </Router>
)
```

If the URL is "/dashboard/invoices" then the Router will render `<Dash><Invoices/></Dash>`. If it's just "/dashboard", `children` will be `null` and we’ll only see `<Dash/>`.

Most apps probably have some sort of global chrome/navigation, that works out just fine:

```jsx
const Main = ({ children }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to the App!</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link to="dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to="invoices">Invoices</Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    {children}
  </div>
)

render(
  <Router>
    <Main path="/">
      <Invoices path="invoices" />
      <Dash path="dashboard" />
    </Main>
  </Router>
)
```

## Relative Links

You can link to relative paths. The relativity comes from the path of the component that rendered the Link. These two links will link to "/dashboard/invoices" and "/dashboard/team" because they're rendered inside of `<Dash/>`. This is really nice when you change a parent's URL, or move the components around.

```jsx
render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard">
      <Invoices path="invoices" />
      <Team path="team" />
    </Dash>
  </Router>
)

const Dash = ({ children }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    <nav>
      <Link to="invoices">Invoices</Link>{" "}
      <Link to="team">Team</Link>
    </nav>
    <hr />
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

This also makes it trivial to render any section of your app as its own application with its own router. If all your links are relative, it can be embedded inside any other router and just work.

## "Index" Paths

Nested components can use the path `/` to signify they should render
at the path of the parent component, like an index.html file inside
a folder on a static server. If this app was at "/dashboard" we'd see this
component tree: `<Dash><DashboardGraphs/></Dash>`

```jsx
render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard">
      <DashboardGraphs path="/" />
      <InvoiceList path="invoices" />
    </Dash>
  </Router>
)
```

## Not Found "Default" Components

Put a default prop on a component and Router will render it when nothing else matches.

```jsx
const NotFound = () => (
  <div>Sorry, nothing here.</div>
)

render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard">
      <DashboardGraphs path="/" />
      <InvoiceList path="invoices" />
    </Dash>
    <NotFound default />
  </Router>
)
```

## Multiple Routers

If you want to match the same path in two places in your app, just render two
Routers. Again, a Router picks a single child to render based on the URL, and
then ignores the rest.

Just makes sure to mark the non-primary router(s) as `primary={false}` so that it doesn't manage the focus on those components.

```jsx
render(
  <div>
    <Sidebar>
      <Router primary={false}>
        <HomeNav path="/" />
        <DashboardNav path="dashboard" />
      </Router>
    </Sidebar>

    <MainScreen>
      <Router>
        <Home path="/">
          <About path="about" />
          <Support path="support" />
        </Home>
        <Dash path="dashboard">
          <Invoices path="invoices" />
          <Team path="team" />
        </Dash>
      </Router>
    </MainScreen>
  </div>
)
```

## Embedded Routers

You can render a router anywhere you want in your app, even deep inside another Router, just makes sure to use a splat (`*`) on the parent component so nested paths match it.

```jsx
render(
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <Dash path="dashboard/*" />
  </Router>
)

const Dash = () => (
  <div>
    <p>A nested router</p>
    <Router>
      <DashboardGraphs path="/" />
      <InvoiceList path="invoices" />
    </Router>
  </div>
)
```

This allows you to have all of your routes configured at the top of the app, or to configure only where you need them, which is really helpful for code-splitting and very large apps. You can even render `Dash` as an independent application.

## Navigating Programmatically

If you need to navigate programmatically (like after a form submits), import `navigate`.

```jsx
import { navigate } from "@reach/router"

const Invoices = () => (
  <div>
    <NewInvoiceForm
      onSubmit={async event => {
        const newInvoice = await createInvoice(
          event.target
        )
        navigate(`/invoices/${newInvoice.id}`)
      }}
    />
  </div>
)
```

Or better, yet, use `props.navigate` passed to your route components and then you can navigate to relative paths:

```jsx
const Invoices = ({ navigate }) => (
  <div>
    <NewInvoiceForm
      onSubmit={async event => {
        const newInvoice = await createInvoice(
          event.target
        )
        // can navigate to relative paths
        navigate(newInvoice.id)
      }}
    />
  </div>
)
;<Router>
  <Invoices path="invoices" />
  <Invoice path="invoices/:id" />
</Router>
```

Navigate returns a promise so you can await it. It resolves after React is completely finished rendering the next screen, even with React Suspense.

```jsx
class Invoices extends React.Component {
  state = {
    creatingNewInvoice: false
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <LoadingBar
          animate={this.state.creatingNewInvoice}
        />
        <NewInvoiceForm
          onSubmit={async event => {
            this.setState({
              creatingNewInvoice: true
            })
            const newInvoice = await createInvoice(
              event.target
            )
            await navigate(
              `/invoice/${newInvoice.id}`
            )
            this.setState({
              creatingNewInvoice: false
            })
          }}
        />
        <InvoiceList />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

That's it!
